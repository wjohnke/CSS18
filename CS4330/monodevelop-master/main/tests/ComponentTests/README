These are component tests for MonoDevelop.

To run a test case, simply run the python script.

e.g.
python CompileAllDefaultProjectTemplates.py

If you'd like to run the tests against a different monodevelop from
/usr/bin/monodevelop, you will need to change the launchMonoDevelop line in the
testcase from:
app = launchMonoDevelop()
to:
app = launchMonoDevelop(exe='/usr/local/bin/monodevelop')
